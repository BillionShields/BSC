Would it be cool if every soda bottle came with a simple label –
instructions on how to do it? Let’s reach to Pepsi and Coke and see what
they can do. Meanwhile, watch the video, make some shields and donate
some to your friends, neighbors and our first responders\! Let’s do this
together\! And maybe we just can save the whole world too\!
