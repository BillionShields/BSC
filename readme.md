Yes, folks, I need your help. We can fight the coronavirus with our
ingenuity\! We can create simple Face Shields from large soda bottles.
Here’s a video on how to do it\! Spread the word and share these
instructions.

Would it be cool if every soda bottle came with a simple label –
instructions on how to do it? Let’s reach to Pepsi and Coke and see what
they can do. Meanwhile, watch the video, make some shields and donate
some to your friends, neighbors and our first responders\! Let’s do this
together\! And maybe we just can save the whole world too\!
